# Answers to Session-1 Assignment Vibe Check

#### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - **Aspect Tested**: Accuracy and communication
    - **Evaluation**:
         - Good : Provided clear explanation using simple, easy to understand examples.
    - **Drawbacks/Areas for Improvement**:
        - Response was not in a very readable format (markdown annotations not properly rendered)
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - **Aspect Tested**: Information Extraction, Synthesis, Accuracy
    - **Evaluation**:
        - Good : The summary/response captured the main points accurately while maintaining completeness
    - **Drawbacks/Areas for Improvement**:
        - The summary could be presented in the same style/tone of the original paragraph, rather than factual data
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - **Aspect Tested**: Creativity, Story-telling and story structure 
    - **Evaluation**:
        - Good : Produced a story based on the constraints provided. Story was simple, imaginative, complete.
    - **Drawbacks/Areas for Improvement**:
        - Pretty-print the response in paragraphs rather than one big paragraph 
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - **Aspect Tested**: Logical resoning and math
    - **Evaluation**:
        -  Good: Was able to use logic to break down the problem. Correct problem-solving approach and calculations (3 packs of apples, 3 packs of oranges) with proper reasoning
     - **Drawbacks/Areas for Improvement**:
        - The response included calculations in raw markdown format. Improvement could be hiding the "work" and showing clean results.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - **Aspect Tested**: Style Adaptation and Tone recognition
    - **Evaluation**:
        - Great : Successfully identified the current tone. Then, changed the style and tone of the provided input to the requested (formal) tone. It also was able to retain the orignal meaning and completeness.
    - **Drawbacks/Areas for Improvement**:
        - Response can seem too wordy. 


##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?    
- Limited coverage: Vibe checks only provide surface-level evaluations, can miss deeper or nuanced problems.
- Subjective & inconsistent: Results vary by who‚Äôs testing ‚Äî not repeatable or comparable.
- No baseline: Hard to tell if performance is actually good without any baseline.
- Not stable: Model behavior can shift, so single vibe checks aren‚Äôt reliable over time.
- Miss edge cases: Unlikely to catch rare failures or underrepresented scenarios.
- No metrics: Can‚Äôt track progress or regressions without quantitative data.
