This lack of transparency led to missed payments, credit issues, or unawareness of when repayment was expected to resume.\\n\\n4. **Financial hardship and stagnant wages:** Many borrowers faced economic challenges such as stagnating wages, job loss, or long-term unemployment, which made consistent repayment impossible despite their efforts.\\n\\n5. **Inadequate or inappropriate handling of payments and loan management:** Issues like difficulty applying extra payments toward principal, automatic placement into forbearance, or mismanagement during loan transfers contributed to ongoing debt and inability to reduce loan balances.\\n\\n6. **Mismanagement and lack of support from loan servicers:** Some borrowers experienced problems with loan servicer communications, including being unaware of repayment obligations, unexpected delinquencies, or incorrect reporting to credit bureaus.\\n\\n7. **High interest rates and long-term debt accumulation:** Years of high interest rates, compounded over time through multiple forbearances or long-term payment plans, caused balances to grow despite ongoing payments.\\n\\nOverall, the combination of systemic issues like poor communication, financial hardship, and loan management practices contributed significantly to borrowers' inability to successfully pay back their loans.\""

        "#### ✅ Answer :\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Mechanism:**\n",
        "- Takes original query → LLM generates multiple variations → Retrieves documents for each → Combines unique results\n",
        "\n",
        "**This improves recall due to:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Query Diversity**: Different ways to ask the same question find different relevant documents\n",
        "   - Original: \"What is the most common issue with loans?\"\n",
        "   - Reformulations: \"What problems do people have with loans?\", \"What are the main loan complaints?\", \"What issues arise with student loans?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Vocabulary Coverage**: Captures synonyms and alternative phrasings\n",
        "   - \"Payment problems\" vs \"billing issues\" vs \"repayment difficulties\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Semantic Variations**: Different angles of the same question retrieve different document subsets\n",
        "   - Some documents might use \"servicer\" instead of \"lender\"\n",
        "   - Some might mention \"forbearance\" instead of \"payment pause\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example from our dataset:**\n",
        "- Original: \"Why did people fail to pay back their loans?\"\n",
        "- Reformulations might include: \"What causes loan default?\", \"Why do borrowers struggle with repayment?\", \"What prevents successful loan payment?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Result:** Higher recall because you're searching with multiple query formulations, each potentially finding different relevant documents that the original query might miss.\n"

        "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
        "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",

        "- Search for small documents\n",
        "- Return big documents\n",

        "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this scenario, there are several **problems** with standard semantic chunking:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Over-chunking**: Short, repetitive sentences will have very similar embeddings, causing the algorithm to create many tiny, redundant chunks\n",
        "2. **Poor semantic boundaries**: FAQs often have similar semantic content across different questions, making it hard to find natural breakpoints\n",
        "3. **Reduced retrieval quality**: Tiny chunks lose context and become less useful for retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adjustments Needed:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increase minimum chunk size**: Set a higher minimum threshold to prevent over-fragmentation\n",
        "2. **Use different thresholding**: Switch from `percentile` to `standard_deviation` or `interquartile` for better handling of repetitive content\n",
        "3. **Pre-process content**: Group similar FAQs before chunking to reduce redundancy\n",
        "4. **Adjust similarity thresholds**: Use higher similarity thresholds to keep related content together\n",
        "5. **Consider hierarchical chunking**: Create larger chunks first, then sub-chunk only when necessary\n",
        "6. **Hybrid Strategy**: Use semantic chunking for longer, diverse content and use fixed-size chunking for repetitive FAQ sections\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Adjustment:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "semantic_chunker = SemanticChunker(\n",
        "    embeddings,\n",
        "    breakpoint_threshold_type=\"standard_deviation\",  # Instead of percentile\n",
        "    min_chunk_size=100,  # Prevent tiny chunks\n",

        ")\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",

        "3. **Query reformulation works**: Multi Query's approach of generating multiple queries improved recall\n",
        "4. **Context matters**: Parent Doc's larger context chunks improved relevancy\n",

        "\n",
        "For this loan complaint dataset, **Compression** offers the optimal balance of performance, cost, and speed. The evaluation demonstrates that advanced retrieval methods can significantly improve RAG system performance, but complexity doesn't always correlate with better results. The choice of retrieval method should be based on specific requirements for accuracy, speed, and cost constraints.\n"
